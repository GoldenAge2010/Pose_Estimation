# Human Pose Estimation in Static Images
## Project for Machine Learning

This project has investigated a novel, flexible extension of tree-based models of part mixtures for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. As seen from the results, our representation can model articulation with comparative speed and accuracy when part mixture models correspond to part orientations. The advantage of this representation is that it provides a general framework for modeling co-occurrence relations between mixtures of parts as well as classic spatial relations between the location of parts.Additionally, more benefits like capturing notions of local rigidity could be achieved using such relations. In summary, impressive performance for the task of human pose estimation has been demonstrated. As future work, we could accelerate the speed of processing and compute trajectories that are close to the raw pose estimates in each frame but also smooth over time. Because we would like to extend our representation to the temporal domain and apply it on videos.
